# Google Play Store Apps Data Visualisation

The aim of this analysis is to provide information about android applications their categories, ratings, and other related information to android users. We also analysed the data for the factors that influence an application, to know why and how certain applications succeed and others. Also, what is required for an application to be considered as successfully topping charts. So, we used dashboards to visualize the information that can be understandable to people even with less technical knowledge. In this study we analysed data using python programming language and we used three different tools for visualisation.

### Tools used for visualization.

1. Microsoft Excel
2. Tablau
3. Power BI
